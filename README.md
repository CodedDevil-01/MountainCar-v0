# MountainCar-v0
Reinforcement Learning 

A RL project with MountainCar-v0 environment ..

The installation :

!pip install stable-baselines3[extra]   (if you are in a notebook)

!pip install gym    (if you are in a notebook)


I have added an aldready trained model too ...

It is trained on 100000 steps ..

You can train it for longer for better results ..
